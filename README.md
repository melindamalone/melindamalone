### Hello, I'm Melinda Malone, and welcome to my GitHub profile👋

I’m a business school graduate from the Bill Munday School of Business at St. Edward’s University in Austin, TX, received certification in Data Analysis and Visualization from the McCombs School of Business at UT Austin, worked nine years in the global supply chain billing operations on behalf of Dell Technologies, and possess a lifetime of customer service experience.

What I enjoy the most is structuring complexities as a data-driven decision-maker and through the development and continuous improvement of operational processes. I’m an analytical and strategic problem-solver, leader, and collaborator with an investigative curiosity.

Currently, I am in pursuit of Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles at an organization where I can serve a mission I can believe in every day. My preferred technologies include Python, SQL, and Tableau.
