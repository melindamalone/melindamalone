# Hello, I'm Melinda, and welcome to my GitHub profileðŸ‘‹![](Images/Melinda_Avatar_Medium.PNG)

### About Me

At this moment, I am in pursuit of Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles in [Austin, TX](https://www.austintexas.org/), or remote opportunities. My preferred on-the-job technologies are SQL, Python, and Tableau. Please check out my [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/melindamalone?tab=repositories) to further understand additional technologies Iâ€™m experienced in using.  If you have any questions or would like to connect, please [email me](mailto:mrs.melindamalone@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Visitor%20from%20GitHub%20Profile), or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melindamalone/)!

What I enjoy the most is structuring complexities and organizing details into interactive reports, visualizations, and presentations for my stakeholders.  Working with large and complex datasets is exciting for me because I'm undeniably driven by facts and data to make decisions in all aspects of my life especially in business. Also, as an analytical and strategic problem-solver, leader, and collaborator with an investigative curiosity, I strive to understand processes in their entirety to either suggest or create methodologies from scratch for the development and continuous improvement of operational processes.
